# PCTR

This repository serves as version control and easy access to the programs used in my Real time and concurrent Programming class. Will be mostly Java stuff, with a bit of Python here and there.

## Getting Started

I don't expect anyone to download this stuff. If you are bored enough, just download the files, compile them with the corresponding compiler, and run them to your heart's content.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a Java JDK installed, preferably 1.8 or higher. Type JDK on Google, the first result should give you the Oracle download page. Get the corresponding JDK for your system and install it. If you choose the zip file option, you'll need to add the bin folder to the system PATH.

### Installing

Don't install this.

## Running the tests

There will most likely be no automated testing.

### Coding style tests

I said no tests.


## Contributing

Don't waste your time with this stuff. There are much better projects out there. 

## Versioning

The version is 1.0. Forever.
